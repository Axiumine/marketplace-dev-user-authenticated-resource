 * would have let through — and the last one is the compliant shape, which must stay silent.
 *
 * The fixtures are `.mts.fixture` rather than `.mts` on purpose: a real `.mts` under `test/` would be
 * linted by `yarn lint` and report the very findings it is here to contain, and adding it to `ignores`
 * would then hide it from this suite too. They are read as text and linted through `lintText` at a

 * TypeScript block carries `parserOptions.project`, and a path under `src/` that no file occupies is
 * not in the TS program — the parser then fails the whole lint with a fatal error and reports no rule
