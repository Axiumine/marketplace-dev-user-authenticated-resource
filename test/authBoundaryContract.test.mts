/*
 * The contract lives in `marketplace-common` and says what every authenticated service's boundary
 * suite has to prove; this file is how *this* service answers for its share of it. Each required case is
 * carried by a `// AB-xx:` comment above the test that proves it, and the assertion below is that none of
 * them is missing — which is the check nobody could run before, because the list existed nowhere.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A tag is a claim, and this test cannot check the claim.** It reads comments: it catches the case
 * nobody wrote a test for, not the test that was gutted while its tag stayed. Deleting an assertion out of
 * a tagged test is still caught, by mutation testing, one gate later.
