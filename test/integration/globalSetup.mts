/**
 * Provision this service's throwaway database before the integration project runs.
 *
 * Two users, the same split production uses:
 *   - the DB OWNER connects here, drops the database and replays every marketplace-db-setup migration,
 *     so the collections the suite writes to carry the real `$jsonSchema` validators and the real
 *     indexes — a seed that violates one is rejected by the server, not by a hand-written copy;
 *   - the R/W user is the one the service under test connects with (see vitest.config.mts).
 *
 * The migrations are read from the sibling repo rather than duplicated. Replaying the files directly
 * is equivalent to `migrate:up`; the `changelog` bookkeeping is migrate-mongo's and is not needed for
 * a database that is dropped on every run.
 *
 * ⚠️ They are immutable but **not** self-contained: every `$jsonSchema` builder lives in
 * `marketplace-db-setup/lib/schemas/`, which each migration requires by relative path. Reading the
 * `migrations/` directory alone is therefore not enough — the whole sibling checkout has to be on
 * disk, which is why the error below points at cloning the repo rather than copying a folder.
