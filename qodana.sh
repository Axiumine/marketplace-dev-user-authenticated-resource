#   - third-party license audit                   (Ultimate Plus, raiseLicenseProblems)
#   - test coverage                               (vitest lcov -> --coverage-dir)

# 100% gate itself (qodana.yaml testCoverageThresholds) and reports the shortfall.
# vitest still writes coverage/lcov.info before it fails on the threshold.

# NOTE: test:cov runs the `integration` project, which boots the server against the REAL
# Redis cluster and the REAL MongoDB (REDIS_* / MONGODB_URI from .env). Two datasources, not
# three: this tier accepts no uploads, so there is no clamd to arm. If either is unreachable,
# integration bails and lcov.info keeps the PREVIOUS run's numbers — Qodana would then scan
# stale coverage. Ensure both are reachable before trusting the coverage verdict. See
