// graphql throws "Duplicate graphql modules / from another realm" when a transformed copy
// (inlined by vitest) and a native copy (externalized in node_modules) meet — which happens
// the moment the real ApolloServer validates the schema. Inlining the whole graphql/Apollo
// chain keeps a single transformed instance across index.mts and Apollo. dedupe pins the path.
//
// marketplace-common and koa-utils are in the list too: the schema embeds GraphQL objects built by
// them (GraphQLBaseAddressFrag, GraphQLAddressFrag, GraphQLPositionFrag, OnlyIdType), so they
// have to see the same transformed graphql copy as the sources. The bare /graphql/ pattern already
// covers graphql-scalars and graphql-depth-limit, which build scalars and
// validation rules from the same package.
