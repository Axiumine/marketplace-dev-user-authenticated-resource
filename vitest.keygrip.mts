 * rotates nothing, so it never opens the record — `assertRedisNamespace` asks only whether the record is
 * *here*, which is how a `REDIS_KEY` naming a namespace nobody seeded is caught at boot instead of being
 * discovered as a 401 on every request. Minting a real key set for the run would put signing material in
 * one of the three tiers `SETUP.md` §7 says must not carry it, to satisfy a check that never looks at it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Provisioned here rather than inherited.** The integration namespace is this suite's own, so
 * `yarn seed:keygrip` has never written into it: the record belongs next to the throwaway database and
 * the throwaway CSFLE key, and is as disposable as both.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Deleted first.** `HSET` merges, so a previous run's fields would otherwise survive under a record
 * this run believes it wrote whole.
